# Welcome To My Portfolio!
This is my first official portfolio website that I created using vanilla HTML/CSS/JavaScript. It contains a header with my logo, about-me, projects and contact sections.

I used a website called [Logomaker](https://www.logomaker.com/) to create a quick logo for the website, used the cropping tool to locally store the logo and an online tool to remove the background and add transparency to the logo.

This is the first iteration of my portfolio website and I will be continuously updating my portfolio website with newer technologies that I will be learning in the future. 

Here's a live version of my portfolio website that's hosted on Heroku: [Christopher Lam's Portfolio Website](https://clam-portfolio-website.herokuapp.com/)
